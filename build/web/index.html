The Ellesmere Sports and Leisure Club (“the automated sports club”) provides cricket, tennis, squash, bowls, and croquet facilities to its members. There is room for improvement in the current procedures for booking sports facilities. Presently, sports users make bookings in person and sports Centre staff record them by hand. Staff currently spends a considerable amount of time administrating the booking of sports Centre facilities. There is currently no way for users to check what bookings they have outstanding without contacting sports Centre staff. This can lead to more unnecessary use of staff time or users missing bookings. By automating above system, administrator organizes, schedules task and maintains the system, users (members) can access and can book sports club tasks through internet, different club promoters can see various tasks and organize them efficiently by using this developing online application. It is felt that there would be benefits to both sports users and staff from automating this process. For this reason, the focus of this project will be on the development a generic solution that is suitable for a variety of sports centers.
